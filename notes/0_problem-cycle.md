# Problem cycle

### Confirm understanding
1. Ensure with the interviewer the intended task in case it's vague.
2. Ask the right questions if there are missing requirements.
3. Don't do assumption on your own unless you share it with the interviewer.
4. Ask about input validation if needed.
5. Develop Test Cases
6. propose verbally a Brute-force solution (good for warm up)
7. Toward the intended solution. O(1),O(log N),O(N log N)O, for matrices (N^2)
8. Feel free to ask for a hint if you can't move forward.
9. Use meaningful variable and function names
10. Each function does one thing (ensure modulerity)
11. write a skelton for your code by meaningful function names, then start implementing the functions with the core logic. that help you in case you run out of time by the end.
12. State the time/space complexity.
